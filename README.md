# checkyoself

a short, AI-powered python script to look for all the naughty words you've ever used on twitter.com (best if used before you wreck yoself) 

```
usage: python checkyoself.py USERNAME
```

### Requirements
`pip install python-twitter`, add a valid consumer key/secret and access key/secret to a file called t.json with the below format:

```json
{
        "consumer_key": "",
        "consumer_secret": "",
        "access_token_key": "",
        "access_token_secret": ""
}
```

, and you're good to go
